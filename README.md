## Overview
This project is a **Book Recommendation System** designed to provide personalized book suggestions based on historical data. The goal is to enhance the reading experience by recommending books aligned with user preferences and interests.

---

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests books based on user-provided inputs.
- **Interactive Web Application:** A user-friendly interface developed with Streamlit.
- **Efficient Analysis:** Uses cosine similarity to find the best matches for user preferences.

---

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is sourced from **Kaggle**, containing comprehensive information about books, authors, genres, ratings, and more.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Cosine Similarity**: To calculate the similarity between books.
- **Pickle**: To save the trained model for later use.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application.

---

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Analysis:** 
   - The dataset is loaded and cleaned using `pandas`.
   - Exploratory analysis is performed to understand the data.

2. **Similarity Calculation:** 
   - Cosine similarity is used to determine the similarity between books.

3. **Model Development:**
   - The recommendation model is built and saved using the `pickle` library.

4. **Interactive Interface:**
   - Users can input book details via a Streamlit app to receive recommendations.

## Installation
To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhanukaushik/BookRecommendationSystem.git
   cd BookRecommend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Open the live link or run the application locally.
2. Enter the details of a book you like (e.g., title, genre, or author).
3. Receive a list of recommended books based on your input.

---

## Model
- **Cosine Similarity**: Finds books similar to the userâ€™s input.
- **Pickle**: Saves and reloads the trained recommendation model for efficiency.

---

## Results
- Provides accurate and relevant book recommendations.
- Enhances user engagement through an interactive and responsive web application.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate user authentication for personalized recommendations.
- Expand the dataset for broader coverage.
- Add features like trending books or genre-specific recommendations.
